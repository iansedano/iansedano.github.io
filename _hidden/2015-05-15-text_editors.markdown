# DRAFT


### Word (not in the list)
My quest with text editors began before I really got into coding. I was tired with Microsoft word. I have never liked software that had loads of functionality that I never use. Especially if that functionality translates into long load times. Anything  over 3 seconds gets on my nerves. Especially if all you want to do is edit plain text. Besides, when functionality occupies screen real-estate, it becomes distracting.

### Evernote
I have always written a lot and taken many notes, and so I found I had many documents that were very short. So I tried Evernote to get me out of load-time hell. I did enjoy using it, and it helped me manage many small notes, yet I was still frustrated by its speed. Sometimes I wanted to edit a single note, without having to open the whole interface and see all of my other notes.

### Notepad
My first breakthrough was when I started using notepad and plain text. It was great. Simple, fast, easy, light. What you see is what you get. I could use explorer folder structure to organize them. Yet I did miss some functionality.

### Notepad++
I stuck with notepad++ for a long time. It is super fast. Even faster than Notepad at times. It had a load of functionality but that didn't prove distracting and didn't slow it down. I could customize the look if it. I could use tabs if I wanted.

I defined custom syntax that was similar to markdown, though I had never heard of markdown. I enabled custom folding markers, made text **bold** and *italicised* to aid navigation.

I explored project functionality, which helped me keep collections together. When I wrote in a journal I could see all the files associated with them in the sidebar. I could jump quickly from file to file. That said I was never really happy with the way projects worked. Something that I have always wanted is for project files to be defined with *relative* paths. I organize my notes, if they aren't organized and accessible, they become useless as notes. This means that sometimes folder structure changes. 

### Sublime Text
Then came Sublime Text. I had installed it once before but I uninstalled it quite quickly. Partly because it seemed far too big for what I wanted, and then I found out that the preferences were adjusted by modifying a huge `json` file and I ran. I didn't know what `json` was and I didn't understand it.

I came back to it when the Python coding course I had signed up to recommended it. It was then I came to appreciate how simple it really was. It did have more functionality than notepad++ but most of it came from plugins which were very easy to install and manage thanks to the Package Control plugin.

I never gave up on notepad++ completely though, it is still my editor of choice when I have to edit single files. It opens fast and has enough syntax highlighting to get by. I uninstalled most of the plugins and have it as my 'quick and dirty' editor.

### VB Editor and "heavyweights"
When I got into Excel VBA I inevitably started using Microsoft's GUI. Its minimal syntax highlighting was hard to bear. The lack of multi-highlights, multi-cursors and many quality of life features were sorely missed. That said, its search and debugging features were great. This led me to adopt Pycharm, just for its step debugging. I am sure that there is probably a lighter CLI version but I haven't found it yet.

Pycharm so far I use exclusively for its step debugging. The rest of it annoys me. The way it creates a .idea folder I am sure has its reasons, I just hate to see extra files in my file manager. Plus I have to remember to `.gitignore` it.

Recently I came to appreciate Visual Studio Code. Its a heavyweight, which I dislike. Yet it has that magic property of "just working". Its terminal seems to work better than anything else on Windows. Git integration is easy. Syntax is up to date. Plugins are easy to install. It also extremely popular. I see myself using it more and more. Possibly to replace Pycharm. Yet for now I use it for its terminal and git when ConEmu is not playing nice. Or to modify Linux files.

### Abricotine
I used sublime in general as my markdown editor, along with some plugins but needed something that gave me an immediate preview. I tried many other editors like Markdown Pad, but the double pane preview I was never really convinced with. Getting the combination right of supporting highlighted code blocks, reliable export, custom CSS, lightweight, fast with real-time "transparent" preview was hard to find. Until I came across Abricotine which does all this.

### My setup

Notepad++ is my lightweight tool for quick edits and fast notes.
Sublime Text is my preferred element for projects and general coding.
Abricotine deals with all my markdown.
The "heavyweights" VB Editor, Pycharm and VS code - for specific tasks that I am sure there is some lightweight modular alternative to do the tasks I need, but when I am frustrated and need a solution, they usually have what I need. Still takes a few minutes to fire them up though.
