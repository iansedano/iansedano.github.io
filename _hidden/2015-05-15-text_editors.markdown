# DRAFT

My quest with text editors began before I really got into coding. I was tired with microsoft word. I have never liked software that had loads of functionality that I never used. Especially if that functionality translated into long load times. 5 second load times are pointless if all you want to do is edit text. Besides, all the functionality gets in the way and takes up screen real-estate.

While I was writing and taking notes, I had many documents that were very short. Opening them up in word was too slow. So I tried services like Evernote. I did enjoy using them, and they helped me manage many small notes well, yet I was still frustrated by its speed. I sometimes wanted to edit a single note, without having to open the whole interface and see all of my other notes from all time.

I started using notepad. Which was great. Simple, fast, easy. My notes were light and I could just use a folder structure to organize things. Yet I did miss some functionality. I also wanted to customise the look of notepad and so I moved to notepad++.

I stuck with notepad++ for a long time. I defined custom syntax that was similar to markdown, though I had never heard of markdown. To do things like enable folding, make text **bold** and other things like that. I used the project functionality and experimented with plugins. That said I was never really happy with the way projects worked (I still haven't found one that I don't have any problems with).

Then came Sublime Text. I had installed it once before but I uninstalled it quite quickly. Partly because it seemed far too big for what I wanted, and then I found out that the preferences were adjusted by modifying a huge `json` file and I ran. I didn't know what `json` was and I didn't understand it.

I came back to it when the Python coding course I had signed up to recommended it. It was then I came to appreciate how simple it really was. It did have more functionality than notepad++ but most of it came from plugins which were very easy to install and manage thanks to the Package Control plugin.

I never gave up on notepad++ completely though, it is still my editor of choice when I have to edit single files. It opens fast and has enough syntax highlighting to get by. I uninstalled most of the plugins and have it as my 'quick and dirty' editor.

When I got into Excel VBA I inevitably started using Microsoft's
