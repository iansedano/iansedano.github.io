# Ian Currie Sedano

### Renaissance developer


## Introduction

I am a experienced well-rounded professional who is technically oriented. I have had many varied experiences throughout my life and have been exposed to many different people and cultures. I have gathered many skills, from artistic to technical, but every road of my interest eventually led me to IT.

I am not afraid to get stuck in. Whether that takes the form of rolling up my sleeves and cleaning up a spill, or diving into a highly technical manual. If it needs to be done to get where we want to be, I am willing to do it.

I am seen as humble, trustworthy, and patient - someone who **listens**. My leadership style is based on mutual understanding and co-operation. I believe that if everyone fully understands what the goals are, progress arises naturally.

All this has made me very good at clarifying and breaking down a realistic goal. Nothing gives me more of a feeling of purpose than learning, and programming is learning **distilled**. I have implemented IT solutions everywhere I have been. I teach, build, create and automate. 


## Professional goals

I would like to be able to work with many aspects of the development cycle, the full-stack, the design philosophy, its maintenance and the business of it.

I want to get stuck into a junior software development position as soon as possible to solidify my skills and start contributing to software at a professional level.

I would like to work for a company where diversity is valued, and yet where there is a very large overlap of values and objectives. Where mistakes are made and learnt from. Where I can be held accountable, but also be given freedom to think and work.

 
## Soft Skills

* Able to clarify goals and missions, getting everyone on the same page and pulling in the same direction.
* Able to mediate and understand people, able to lead and able to serve.
* Able to think and solve problems laterally and creatively.
* Not afraid to start-again if there is a better way.
* Able to finish projects and not let "feature-creep" take over.


## Significant Experiences

* Developing a way of working with IT from the ground up.
	* A slow start persuading colleagues (many of whom were technologically adverse) by **evangelizing** the benefits and talking one-on-one to understand the resistance.
	* I demonstrated software such as **Dropbox**, **Google Sheets**, **Google Docs**, **SQL**. I demonstrated what was possible with simple scripts in **VBA** or **Python**.
	* I **piloted** solutions (out of my own pocket) from adopting Dropbox, to paying developers to consult with and explore options such as **Ruby on Rails**, **Access**, **Django**.
	* **Incremented** progress slowly by **introducing** behaviours and technologies that lead to the final solution.
	* Eventually implementing a **server**, **database** and touch-screen and bar-code **interface** in the factory which has been in use now for 5 years.

* Become the expert in complicated **logistics** projects.
	* On own **initiative** looked into the **technicalities** of **customs** and shipping **procedures**, from vehicle **specifications** to **legal** requirements.
	* Was **organized** enough to manage and present all the **data** required, update all involved parties, and keep things moving. **Excel**, **ERP**, **CAD**

* Discovering **VBA** through **Excel**.
	* I initially started using **Excel** to manage all my data and loved it.
	* I had taken some programming classes but when I started to program things that were really useful to my everyday work, something clicked in me and have since seen an acceleration in my learning and abilities.

* Becoming the IT expert wherever I end up.
	* I was tasked with **web development** and **deploying** websites. **wordpress**, **plesk**, basic **HTML**, **CSS**, **Javascript**, **DNS**, **domains**.
	* IT **support** and **troubleshooting**.
	* **Building** desktops, **repairing** and **upgrading** laptops.
	* **Installing** software and setting up **configuration** (on site and with **teamviewer**, **ammy**)
	* **Teaching** and **coaching** all levels of competence.
 

## Significant Relationships

* Juan Pi Andreu - My long-time manager, a wealth of experience and patience. He seems to have guidance for any situation.
* Ryan Desmond - founder of Coding Nomads.
* Andreu Tortajada - IT Project Manager at Barcelona Council
* Pablo Moles - Senior Developer at Oracle

## Q & A

###¿Cuáles son tus principales herramientas de trabajo (IDEs, editores de texto, clientes de correo, Excel...) y cómo las utilizas (plugins, configuraciones, trucos)?

My preferred development environment is a combination of Sublime Text 3 with various plugins and Visual Studio Code. I use Windows Subsystem for Linux for all Linux tasks.

I use gmail as a "back-end" and if the account is not very active, for advanced searches and filters. For my day to day use I use Thunderbird with folders which I organize in such as way that it serves as part of a to-do list. I prefer keeping things in plain text as much as possible.

I track my tasks with a combination of my physical notebook that I carry everywhere, a txt file that I use with the Sublime Text plugin PlainTasks. Recently I have also used Trello and Github projects to organize tasks within a team.

I keep everything synchronized between systems with Git and Dropbox. Everything I write is on the cloud. Many of the utility programs I use are portable and live within Dropbox. If I can save configurations online, like Sublime, they are pushed to all my devices.

I am a big fan of open-source software.

See my article detailing all the programs I set up on my new computer.


###¿Qué recursos online (webs, blogs, apps, foros, etc) usas para ayudarte a desempeñar tu trabajo?

While working:
I like to go straight to the official documentation of whatever tool I am using and have that open.

Failing that I do a quick Google keyword search which will usually take me to a forum somewhere, often StackOverflow.

Failing that I will usually post on StackOverflow or a more specialized forum.

At other times:
I like to listen to various podcasts on coding and watch youtube videos on software development, new technologies, lectures from congresses and universities, crazy projects people have come up with. 


###¿Qué nuevas tecnologías y/o herramientas te llaman especialmente la atención y por qué?

I am very interested in Terraform and the whole movement behind infrastructure as code. I believe this is an important frontier for programmers everywhere.

I am also of course interested in General AI as it represents for me one of the dreams of programmers everywhere. It is like the pursuit of the unifying theory for physicists.


###¿Hay alguna empresa tecnológica que te llame la atención por lo bien que lo está haciendo?

I am pleasantly surprised that Microsoft are moving strongly into Open Source territory. Visual Studio Code is a great piece of software and their integration with Github I believe has been great for them and their products. They are also integrating Linux functionality via WSL which is also fantastic.

I also admire Gruntwork.io who are greatly developing the "infrastructure as code" movement, while also Open Sourcing a lot of their work.

### ¿Cómo intentas mantener actualizados tus conocimientos y habilidades profesionales?

I like to absorb new information and new perspectives, it is what keeps me motivated. I always enjoy having personal projects to develop different skills. I also like to write about processes, talk, discuss and debate practices and philosophies. I like to learn from people by asking and observing.

### ¿Sueles compartir tu conocimiento por algún canal (posts, foros, contribución a open source, charlas públicas etc)?

The coding school I went to has a Slack channel and a Forum, I always try and answer questions there and help steer new coders in the right direction.
Pythontutor is a site where I often help people with their Python code.
I try and answer questions I can in StackOverflow, though there are many very experienced people there and am usually late! Though my answers for VBA have sometimes been accepted.
I also have a personal website which I use as a blog for many subjects, a repository for installation or configuration instructions that are shared publicly, or as a showcase for public projects.

### ¿Hay alguna tarea o función que hayas realizado a lo largo de tu carrera profesional de la que te sientas especialmente orgulloso?

I am proud of the time tracking solution I slowly developed with no outside help, developing a basic architecture from scratch, and for it to be successful.

###¿Hay alguna tarea o función que hayas realizado a lo largo de tu carrera profesional que te hubiera gustado hacer de otra manera?

The same time tracking solution. If I could go back with the knowledge I have now, I would have been able to make sounder design decisions, have more confidence in my instinct, and been able to deliver a far better product.

### ¿Qué cualidades y conocimientos crees que debe tener un buen profesional en tu puesto?

A sound technical and logical mind. An experimental approach. Empathy and imagination. Good communication skills. Being able to value decisions from a "big picture" perspective but also be able to get stuck into "local battles"

### ¿Qué habilidades y valores crees que debería tener un buen líder?

They should be able to listen to people, understand them and validate their thoughts and feelings. They should also have a strong vision and be able to create belief and enthusiasm around that vision.

They should value humanity, in all its facets, they should believe in progress.

### ¿Cómo sería el equipo de trabajo del que te sentirías orgulloso de formar parte?

A team where everyone is working towards the same goal. Where differences can be suspended while the next immediate steps are made. Where everyone helps each other grow and be better. Where learning is valued and treasured. Where a basic respect is maintained.

###¿Cómo sería la empresa en donde te gustaría trabajar?

A company that values innovation and contribution. That documents well and is interested in lasting solutions. Where a collective effort pays off to the collective. Where loyalty and hard work are valued. Where fairness is more common than injustice. In a open and transparent company, but without losing a sense of direction, or having its goals drowned out by too many constrasting viewpoints or responsabilities. Where meetings are productive, not absent or too frequent. 

###¿Cómo sería la empresa en donde NO te gustaría de trabajar?

A company that lags behind technologically. That has a strict hierarchy based on nepotism. Where meetings are long, tedious, and where humiliation is often practiced. Where the bottom-line is everything and employee satisfaction or life-work balance is ignored. Where fear is employed as a motivational tool.
