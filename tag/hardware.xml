&lt;p&gt;Juan Nieto and I decided to start playing together in around 2016 to see what we could come up with. We didn’t have many expectations going in but after a couple sessions playing covers I started to experiment with getting a computer involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first song that really started the process was when I set up a simple loop and went between playing different key and guitar sounds. There was something magical in the interplay between the rigid loop and the organic rhythyms of Juan. His exuberance was well suited to the textures I made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every week I had something new to show him, and he started to call it “la maquina del espacio-tiempo” (the space-time machine), he even coined a catchphrase for it - “it can not only take you back and forward in time, but sideways too”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On of the defining features of the “machine” was to be an &lt;em&gt;alesis perc pad&lt;/em&gt;. It became our bass instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>MIDI for the bridge</title>
   <link href="http://example.com/2018/07/01/Midi_bridge.html"/>
   <updated>2018-07-01T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>http://example.com/2018/07/01/Midi_bridge</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This post will be an overview of the MIDI system I used for The Bridge. It is part of a series. See presentation post &lt;a href=&quot;/music/2018-12-15-time_machine/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;objective&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To be able to externalize all controls so that the laptop would only have to be touched in case of emergency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Numerous Midi devices&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some of these devices were midi USB and were unreliable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Designing and programming the complex system without requiring changes down the line.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Overcoming software limitations when programming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;harware&quot;&gt;Harware&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;perc pad - our bass instrument&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;keyboard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;synth - for some sounds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;foot-pedal - to control the looper&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Midi-mix - as a master mixer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;NanoKontrol - as an additional mixer for the looper and global effects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these devices apart from the synth were inputs to the interface. The only devices that received MIDI outputs were the synth and the Midi-mix.
The Midi-mix and NanoKontrol were USB MIDI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;connections&quot;&gt;Connections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/h8mm3qtqjm5nga8/midisix4pix.jpg?raw=1&quot; class=&quot;post-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/kalq9f9l4cdoon1/uhmr.jpg?raw=1&quot; class=&quot;post-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These three devices were the cheapest way I could get everything to work smoothly. They are, a midi splitter, a merger, and a usb to midi host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was how I laid it out in the rack:
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/bmhr5ylg66hdg0p/midi_connections_annotated.jpg?raw=1&quot; class=&quot;post-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made custom midi cables to length so that any interference would be cut down to a minimum, thats why you can see such perfectly lengthed MIDI Cables!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All MIDI ins eventually needed to go to the interface, and all devices that needed to receive MIDI, the MIDI message had to come from the interface. This was all managed by assigning channels to the midi devices (MIDI has 16 channels).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/gjaq29zel9an4m5/200522_120128_EXCEL.png?raw=1&quot; class=&quot;post-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the excel in which I kept planned out all the mappings and channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-daw&quot;&gt;The DAW&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The design in the DAW went through various iterations, starting out in Reaper and ending up in Ableton Live.
The first iteration looked like this:
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/ndq0o4qdskyuhl6/Annotation%202020-05-22%20101219.jpg?raw=1&quot; class=&quot;post-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a mess. The main problem I had was that I ended up with too many tracks to manage, to many sub mixes. This was solved by moving into ableton where Instrument Racks effectively allow you to have as many tracks as you want, but they all live within one track. It just makes everything much easier to manage. I probably had more fine grain control in Reaper, but for live performance, Ableton Live was much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/s9ssdmitzjrk8n5/Annotation%202020-05-22%20101907.jpg?raw=1&quot; class=&quot;post-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything just looked cleaner, easier to understand and control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-control-panel&quot;&gt;The control panel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here is an image of the controls that I programmed in for the MidiMix.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/0uxf26uv7rqhuso/2018-11-19%2019.26.32.jpg?raw=1&quot; class=&quot;post-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the bottom were almost always the master volume for each track. The knobs along the top were for FX controls. In the case of the pad, it was also to control the key and scale it was using. The buttons were used to enable specific sends and configured to light up when they were active. Later in this post I will go into more detail about how exactly I managed to program this with the aid of much research and Bome Midi Translator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;keys&quot;&gt;Keys&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/o1owicjxj0r2ipe/Key%20instrument.png?raw=1&quot; class=&quot;post-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was easy, just a simple instrument selector. I had organ sounds, piano sounds, I could route to the hardware synth, and pad like sounds for atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-bass-pads&quot;&gt;The Bass Pads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe class=&quot;insta-iframe&quot; src=&quot;//www.instagram.com/p/BlgGenznyRm/embed/&quot; width=&quot;612&quot; height=&quot;710&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/c9qe4awl7qskf2e/pad%20instrument.png?raw=1&quot; class=&quot;post-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was how it was set up. First the MIDI stream ran through a scale converter. When I say scale I say selection of 5 notes. It rode the line between a chord arpegio and a pentatonic scale. The root note was always on the foot pedal of the percpad, and the 4 other notes were complementary, the 3rd, the 5th etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it ran through a transposer that modified the key. I designed it so it would switch in 5ths going up and in 4ths going down, like the circle of fifths. This allowed us to implement some simple chord changes on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally a transposer to adjust the octave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spreadsheet I used to map out / compose the bass notes is below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/3jciensp2g5xcb5/200522_120152_EXCEL.png?raw=1&quot; class=&quot;post-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general the I always had a note that was the 4th, then another sub-dominant functioning scale degree. Almost always the flat 7th, and for the dominant wither a 5th degree, an octave of the root, a 2nd degree or a tritone. Once I had everything in Ableton Live, it was much easier to adjust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had some instruments at the end of the chain, but we mainly used the pad to control the hardware synth as that had many more tone shaping possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Taking a Hack-saw to an FCB1010</title>
   <link href="http://example.com/personal%20projects/2017/05/02/fcb1010_cut.html"/>
   <updated>2017-05-02T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>http://example.com/personal%20projects/2017/05/02/fcb1010_cut</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;https://www.dropbox.com/s/86kkf1ezc03c6pt/2016-10-26%2012.37.20%20-%20Copy.jpg?raw=1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking the pedals off a FCB1010 with a hacksaw.
This article is one in a series where I write about the most complicated, but most fun live setup I have ever had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many midi footpedals on the market, but none perhaps as both robust and cheap as the FCB1010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/8f0iswsx4n3iylj/FCB1010.jpg?raw=1&quot; class=&quot;post-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many forums online dedicated to this footpedal and even custom EPROM chips you can buy to customize it’s function. The programming of this pedal is an article in itself so I will write another soon, about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I did realize quite quickly is that the pedals that came on my unit were not very good. I have heard there is some variability, and if you are lucky, your pedals are actually useable. My issue with them was that they hardly had any range and the range they had was not fully responsive. Anyway, I decided that I would chop them off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After commiting to this, you look inside the machine and take the pedals off (abel the wires in case you want to later install jacks for external foot pedals) you will see the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/5wrg50ajcpkaqfq/2016-10-04%2015.21.53-2.jpg?raw=1&quot; class=&quot;post-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the far left is the power socket (like a printer power cable), power switch, transformer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From some reading online I found that the transformer steps down to 9V and then a diode array converts it to DC. So why not just use a guitar pedal power supply?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/hp0907t71mcfsdt/2016-10-04%2015.32.48.jpg?raw=1&quot; class=&quot;post-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two yellow wires go to the diode array. You can use a center positive or a center negative 9V DC power supply. Just like a guitar pedal would. So you can just rip out the power socket, switch and transformer. I installed a small guitar pedal power jack, and wired it up (polarity doesnt matter due to diode array).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then comes the long task of hacksawing through the aluminium chassis while trying to maintain a straight line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/hdtwnzdvahtt8b4/2016-10-05%2009.13.40.jpg?raw=1&quot; class=&quot;post-img&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/0ys75t8ic9r8zd6/2016-10-05%2009.47.08.jpg?raw=1&quot; class=&quot;post-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always thought the black plastic cheeks of the unit were unnecesarily bulky and ugly so I decided to try and carve some wooden cheeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/m9llflj9p6zswf1/2016-10-05%2013.38.03.jpg?raw=1&quot; class=&quot;post-img&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/ar1cfzbf6xvrqf1/2016-10-26%2012.37.25.jpg?raw=1&quot; class=&quot;post-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a long time also, and my fit up wasn’t great but I was happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/c95kmja44kyv5e1/2016-10-05%2018.04.38.jpg?raw=1&quot; class=&quot;post-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has run on a guitar pedal power supply ever since! I have never had it be underpowered, even when daisy chaining. Its much more compact and lighter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/uuz5uwr2cukx05g/2016-10-26%2012.37.20.jpg?raw=1&quot; class=&quot;post-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up buying another and did the same. Which I then sold, but while I used it I never had any problems, and the buyer left a nice review and have not heard from him since.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tracking Time</title>
   <link href="http://example.com/2017/02/05/time_tracking.html"/>
   <updated>2017-02-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://example.com/2017/02/05/time_tracking</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;https://www.dropbox.com/s/t4aja50e62if07j/FSConvert%2001.jpg?raw=1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a write-up of my multi-year project that culminated in a time-tracking software and hardware solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-foundry&quot;&gt;The Foundry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;some-background&quot;&gt;Some Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/6tzn17dgnllkuxq/IMG_9005.JPG?raw=1&quot; class=&quot;post-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “lost-wax” method of making sculptures has its origins possibly 6000 years ago, and today is still largely unchanged. So it was not surprising that the foundry had no need for much technology. When I first visited the foundry, only the General Administrator had a computer. As it turned out, most were technologically averse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the 2008 financial crisis eternally unfolding in the background, this foundry had secured a partnership with a prominent artist, who had in turn secured a contract with a famous gallery. While businesses were closing, operations in the foundry were ramping up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first order of business was establishing some lines of communication between the needs of the gallery, the constraints of the artist and the abilities of the foundry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/uwgx4ka0ym26mu9/2015-01-28%2011.23.33.jpg?raw=1&quot; class=&quot;post-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the world of the gallery, e-mail and spreadsheets were ubiquitous. They would send through “London-style” messages, asking the impossible, the ridiculous, but at least they did so with some aloof politeness and a spreadsheet attached. The owner of the foundry would read it and become incensed. He couldn’t believe how brash they were, and how much they asked for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What he didn’t know was that the messages from the gallery should have been read as a wish-list and not a demand. I can’t blame him for not realizing this. The e-mail was full of words like: “must be”, “asap”, “no delay” and “deadline”. What the gallery wanted in response was - “Ok, we’ll do out best and keep you informed of our progress.” Instead, response from foundry: “Impossible!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stereotypes are real only in the sense that people rely on them, and in most cases, are just negative oversimplifications. The foundry came to look upon the gallery as arrogant and the gallery came to look upon the foundry as lazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stepped in and started to mediate the conversation as soon as possible, this allowed each party to focus on their work and not get frustrated with miscommunications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/t4aja50e62if07j/FSConvert%2001.jpg?raw=1&quot; class=&quot;post-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;spreadsheets&quot;&gt;Spreadsheets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These became our bread and butter. The gallery, as the sole client, wanted numbers, dates and progress reports. Without any IT infrastructure, we started tracking individual sculptures from order to delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time there were around 30 artisans working making the sculptures. The number of sculptures that could be simultaneously in production were about 50. Though, depending on the size of the sculptures, only 20 or so could be worked on simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first steps I took was defining a series of steps that the sculpture needed to go through. The simplified version of which was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wax&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ceramic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Casting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chiselling / Sandblasting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mounting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finishing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Crating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I implemented a simple priority system using numbers from 1 to 5. We had progress bars to indicate which stage of production the sculpture was in. It was also a place to store technical specifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around this time I convinced everyone to use Dropbox or Google Suite so we could collaborate and not rack up hundreds of versions of spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/2ozns1litytfmwo/FSConvert%2002.jpg?raw=1&quot; class=&quot;post-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-entry&quot;&gt;Data Entry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had always assumed that somehow, the work of data entry would eventually be distributed or automated. The spreadsheet was being asked to track too much information for one spreadsheet to handle. Even if we did have state-of-the-art software, one person wouldn’t be able to handle all the data entry in real-time. Yet, management expected one person to make it happen. That person happened to be the Floor Manager, who already had enough on his plate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I helped design the spreadsheet to be as user-friendly as possible, but it was not enough. I saw the solution, and it involved multiple computers or tablets distributed around the foundry that were able to update a central database, or even a google spreadsheet. Yet this suggestion fell on deaf ears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a year or so of trying to persuade them, the floor manager left his position and the next in line was unable to keep up. I saw an opportunity. In an effort to make an incremental change towards my goal, I proposed some manual time-sheets. Each worker would fill out a piece of paper, by hand, and hand it to an office assistant, who would be tasked with entering it into a spreadsheet. Obviously a bad solution, but it turned out to be an essential stepping stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spoke with the assistant in private and told them that they were never going to be able to keep up with the flow of data. That the best thig they could do was process a few time-sheets everyday and keep the backlog organized in boxes. The boxes piled up and soon my strategy had paid off - I was being asked to investigate subcontractors to implement a “proper” solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/ro9euh9os42rbyz/IMG_8984.JPG?raw=1&quot; class=&quot;post-img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implementation&quot;&gt;Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was underqualified for this job. Yet there was no better alternative, so I did the best I could. I made mistakes along the way but in the end, we got a stable system to do what we wanted it to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at many different proposals, and in the end I chose one that supported touch screens, bar-code scanning and most importantly, the option to view your data in a spread-sheet, where you can edit values directly, like a spread-sheet. This was because it had been made clear that no one was going to learn a new interface. If it was at least spread-sheet like, there wouldn’t be any issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came long meeting to discuss the specifications of implementation. I was always clear that what I wanted from the company was a simple solution to the bounded problem of time-tracking. I needed their help procuring and setting up the server, the database and the touch-screen network. From there, we could develop our own solutions for reporting, or develop it in conjunction with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for my simple and reliable plan, someone in management had spoken to the salesman, and the plan began to get complex. The salesman had convinced them that their “extended” software package would able to achieve everything they could wish for. We ended up buying the whole package from them, with the promise that they would be able to customize their product towards out needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial spec I had drawn up was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;install touch-screens with bar-code scanners.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;install a server and a database.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;create a UI for workers to identify themselves, the piece they were working on, and what they were doing to the piece.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;make the data available for us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The renewed spec contained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;all of the above&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;e-mail notifications if a worker had spent 30min inactive&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;automatic invoice creation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;repository for all data relating to artwork&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;shipping dashboard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;material costs for every sculptures down to the gram&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was to become the all-singing, all-dancing machine of the future. Many of the features were left vague and undefined. Such as the “shipping dashboard” - no details were discussed. Nevertheless, I had to do my best to cooperate and make sure it wasn’t a failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn’t take long for their team to assign me endless configuration tasks. They asked me to start defining every single separate part of every single sculpture, manually. It quickly became obvious that their tech-support didn’t know what they were doing, and then the salesman had become “unavailable”. When they told me that I couldn’t even copy a ‘set’ of parts from one sculpture edition to the next, I had had it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spend hours on the phone with management and the technical team compromising and deciding how to implement something closer to my simplified spec, from which if we needed, we could build on later. Many intense days later and barring some minor server connection hiccups, we had it up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;training-and-maintenance&quot;&gt;Training and Maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we proceeded to train the staff. I trained them all individually and incorporated feedback to the workflow. The whole process of training took around 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would analyse the data in Python using Pandas every week to begin with and then every month, to collect data about how the system was being used. With some targeted training dispensed as needed. By year 1, it was stable and the initial objectors were now dependent on the system, grateful that they no longer had to constantly verbally report their activities or write them down by hand. Management were also extremely pleased to be able to start to understand what the most time consuming tasks were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, it has been used everyday, to track hours, to track progress of individual sculptures, and for invoicing. Its data has informed decisions at every level of the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately those extra features that we were promised by the salesman were never delivered!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a picture of one of the terminals today.
